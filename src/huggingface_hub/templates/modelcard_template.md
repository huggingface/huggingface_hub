## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->
Build SwiftUI apps with nothing but a sentence ‚Äî powered by GPT-4.

Ever had a killer app idea, but opening Xcode felt like staring into the sun? üß†‚ö°Ô∏è

Meet SwiftGenie ‚Äî a command-line sidekick that takes your idea and conjures up a SwiftUI app scaffold in seconds. Built with Node.js, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4, and a little VibeCode magic, it's designed for indie devs, startup dreamers, and code-tinkerers who just want to build cool stuff fast.

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

Why I built this
I kept seeing friends and founders with amazing ideas struggle to get that first screen coded. The startup friction was killing the momentum. So I built a way to make app building feel as easy as dreaming out loud.

SwiftGenie is here to bridge the gap between imagination and execution.
