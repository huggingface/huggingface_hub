"""Contains command to upload a repo or file with the CLI.

Usage:
    # Upload file (implicit)
    hf upload my-cool-model ./my-cool-model.safetensors

    # Upload file (explicit)
    hf upload my-cool-model ./my-cool-model.safetensors  model.safetensors

    # Upload directory (implicit). If `my-cool-model/` is a directory it will be uploaded, otherwise an exception is raised.
    hf upload my-cool-model

    # Upload directory (explicit)
    hf upload my-cool-model ./models/my-cool-model .

    # Upload filtered directory (example: tensorboard logs except for the last run)
    hf upload my-cool-model ./model/training /logs --include "*.tfevents.*" --exclude "*20230905*"

    # Upload with wildcard
    hf upload my-cool-model "./model/training/*.safetensors"

    # Upload private dataset
    hf upload Wauplin/my-cool-dataset ./data . --repo-type=dataset --private

    # Upload with token
    hf upload Wauplin/my-cool-model --token=hf_****

    # Sync local Space with Hub (upload new files, delete removed files)
    hf upload Wauplin/space-example --repo-type=space --exclude="/logs/*" --delete="*" --commit-message="Sync local Space with Hub"

    # Schedule commits every 30 minutes
    hf upload Wauplin/my-cool-model --every=30
