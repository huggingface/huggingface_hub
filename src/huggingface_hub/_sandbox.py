        Each sandbox is a full isolated VM, so this is the right choice for GPU
        workloads or untrusted code. To fan out many cheap CPU sandboxes instead, use
        [`SandboxPool`].

        The job runs with a fixed 24h maximum lifetime; `idle_timeout` is the real
        keeper — an idle sandbox shuts itself down well before that.

            image (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"python:3.12"`):

                Hardware flavor, e.g. `"cpu-basic"`, `"a10g-small"`. See `hf jobs hardware`.
            idle_timeout (`int` or `float` or `str`, *optional*, defaults to `600`):
                Auto-shutdown after this much inactivity (no API calls, no running
                processes). Defaults to 10 minutes; pass `None` to disable.
            env (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Environment variables available in the sandbox.
            secrets (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Secret environment variables (encrypted server-side).
            volumes (`List[Volume]`, *optional*):
                HF repos/buckets to mount, see [`Volume`].
            namespace (`str`, *optional*):
                User or org namespace to run under (defaults to current user).
            forward_hf_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                If True, your HF token is injected as `HF_TOKEN` (opt-in).
            start_timeout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `120.0`):
                Max seconds to wait for the sandbox to become ready.
            token (`str`, *optional*):
                HF token override.

        The image only needs `/bin/sh`. The sandbox server is downloaded at startup with
        `wget`/`curl` if available, otherwise read off an always-mounted server bucket (which
        adds ~2-3s to cold start, so shipping `wget`/`curl` keeps it fast).

        upgrades and streamed responses. Pair it with [`proxy_headers`] for auth.

        How the sandbox must listen on `port`:

        - **Pool / shared sandbox**: it cannot bind a TCP port (Landlock), so bind a
          **unix socket** at `$SBX_PROXY_DIR/<port>.sock` (the `SBX_PROXY_DIR` env var

        - **Dedicated sandbox**: bind a normal TCP port on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. (You can
          also expose the port directly via the job proxy without going through here.)

                URL scheme to build the link with. Defaults to `"https://"`; pass
                `"wss://"` for a WebSocket client (the proxy is protocol-agnostic, so only

    One host is one billed HF Job (a VM); it runs the sandbox server and multiplexes
    up to `sandboxes_per_host` lightweight sandboxes, isolated from each other by
    uid + the Landlock LSM. This makes large fan-outs cheap (the VM cost is shared
    across all its sandboxes) and fast (creating a sandbox is ~one proxy round-trip
    once a host is warm). Best for many parallel CPU sandboxes such as RL rollouts;
    for GPU or strong VM-level isolation between mutually-distrusting workloads, use
    [`Sandbox.create`] instead.

    The constructor pre-provisions `warm_up` hosts (default 1) and blocks until they are
    ready; further hosts are then provisioned on demand as sandboxes are requested, and all
    are torn down on `close()` (or when idle, via `idle_timeout`). The user never manages jobs:

    ```python
    >>> from huggingface_hub import SandboxPool
    >>> with SandboxPool(image="python:3.12", flavor="cpu-basic", warm_up=2) as pool:
    ...     boxes = [pool.create() for _ in range(100)]   # packed across the warm hosts
    ...     print(boxes[0].run("echo hi").stdout)
    hi
    ```

    `create()` makes **one** sandbox at a time: it reuses a host that still has free
    capacity before booting a new one, so you grow on demand as work arrives. To avoid
    a cold start on the first few calls, pre-provision hosts with `warm_up` (or
    [`warm`]). Warm hosts are discovered via job labels, so reuse works **across
    processes** too (a fresh pool with the same `image`/`flavor`/`name` attaches to
    hosts an earlier run left behind):

    ```python
    >>> pool = SandboxPool(image="python:3.12")
    >>> sbx = pool.create()    # finds a warm host (here or in another process), else boots one
    ```

                Hardware flavor for the host jobs (e.g. `"cpu-basic"`).
            sandboxes_per_host (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `50`):

                count towards it, so only the shortfall is booted; capped by `max_hosts`.

                Optional cap on the number of host jobs (a cost ceiling). When
                reached and all hosts are full, `create()` raises.
            name (`str`, *optional*):
                Pool name, used as the `hf-sandbox-pool` job label so the pool is
                discoverable (e.g. `hf sandbox pool ls`, `connect()`). `create()` reuses
                running hosts carrying this label (including from other processes) before
                booting new ones, so distinct names keep separate pools from sharing hosts.
                A random name is generated when omitted.
            idle_timeout (`int` or `float` or `str`, *optional*, defaults to `600`):
                Host idle timeout — a host shuts down once it has had no
                sandboxes for this long (a billing backstop). Each sandbox also has its
                own idle timeout, set at `create()`. Pass `None` to disable.

                User or org namespace to run hosts under.
            start_timeout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `120.0`):
                Max seconds to wait for a host to become ready.
