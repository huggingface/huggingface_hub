# Proposed Follow-up Tasks

1. **Fix typo in `utils/check_all_variable.py`**
   - Correct the misspelling "prefered" to "preferred" in the `parse_all_definition` docstring to keep developer tooling documentation polished. The typo appears at line 46.

2. **Handle `requests` timeouts properly in `_inner_post`**
   - Update `InferenceClient._inner_post` to catch `requests.exceptions.Timeout` (and possibly `ConnectTimeout`) instead of the built-in `TimeoutError`. Currently timeouts raised by `requests` bypass the custom `InferenceTimeoutError`, so callers do not receive the documented exception (see lines 320-333).

3. **Fix mislabeled section header in `_runtime.py`**
   - The comment preceding the `is_gradio_available` helper incorrectly reads `# FastAI`; update it to reference Gradio for consistency with the functions it documents (lines 127-133).

4. **Deduplicate safetensors metadata parsing in tests**
   - Introduce a helper (or fixture) in `tests/test_serialization.py` to decode safetensors metadata instead of repeating the `struct.unpack` slicing logic in multiple tests (lines 419-423). This will make the test intent clearer and reduce maintenance overhead.
