# Hugging Face Hub API Endpoints


We have open endpoints that you can use to retrieve information from the Hub as well as perform certain actions such as creating model, dataset or Space repos. We offer a wrapper Python library, [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub), that allows easy access to these endpoints. We also provide a [webhook](#webhook) to receive real-time incremental info about repos. Enjoy!

## Webhook

If you ever need to programmatically get notified about all the changes/additions to model/dataset/Space repositories on the Hugging Face Hub, you can subscribe to the Hugging Face Hub webhook.

When you're subscribed – meaning you sent us a URL on your side that you want us to ping – we will call it over HTTP with the following payload:

```python
{ "add": "user/model_id" }
# or
{ "add": "datasets/user/dataset_id" }
# or
{ "update": "spaces/organization/space_id" }
# or
{ "remove": "user/model_id" }
```

✉️ Contact us at `website at huggingface.co` if you would like to subscribe to the webhook.
