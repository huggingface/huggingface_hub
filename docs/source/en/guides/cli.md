# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The `huggingface_hub` Python package comes with a built-in CLI called `huggingface-cli`. This tool allows you to interact with the Hugging Face Hub directly from a terminal. For example, you can login to your account, create a repository, upload and download files, etc. It also comes with handy features to configure your machine or manage your cache. In this guide, we will have a look at the main features of the CLI and how to use them.

## Getting started

First of all, let's install the CLI:

```
>>> pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
```

<Tip>

In the snippet above, we also installed the `[cli]` extra dependencies to make the user experience better, especially when using the `delete-cache` command.

</Tip>

Once installed, you can check that the CLI is correctly setup:

```
>>> huggingface-cli --help
usage: huggingface-cli <command> [<args>]

positional arguments:
  {env,login,whoami,logout,repo,upload,download,lfs-enable-largefiles,lfs-multipart-upload,scan-cache,delete-cache,tag}
                        huggingface-cli command helpers
    env                 Print information about the environment.
    login               Log in using a token from huggingface.co/settings/tokens
    whoami              Find out which huggingface.co account you are logged in as.
    logout              Log out
    repo                {create} Commands to interact with your huggingface.co repos.
    upload              Upload a file or a folder to a repo on the Hub
    download            Download files from the Hub
    lfs-enable-largefiles
                        Configure your repository to enable upload of files > 5GB.
    scan-cache          Scan cache directory.
    delete-cache        Delete revisions from the cache directory.
    tag                 (create, list, delete) tags for a repo in the hub

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

If the CLI is correctly installed, you should see a list of all the options available in the CLI. If you get an error message such as `command not found: huggingface-cli`, please refer to the [Installation](../installation) guide.

<Tip>

The `--help` option is very convenient for getting more details about a command. You can use it anytime to list all available options and their details. For example, `huggingface-cli upload --help` provides more information on how to upload files using the CLI.

</Tip>

### Alternative install

#### Using pkgx

[Pkgx](https://pkgx.sh)  is a blazingly fast cross platform package manager that runs anything. You can install huggingface-cli using pkgx as follows:

```bash
>>> pkgx install huggingface-cli
```

Or you can run huggingface-cli directly:

```bash
>>> pkgx huggingface-cli --help
```

Check out the pkgx huggingface page [here](https://pkgx.dev/pkgs/huggingface.co/) for more details.

#### Using Homebrew

You can also install the CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
>>> brew install huggingface-cli
```

Check out the Homebrew huggingface page [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/huggingface-cli) for more details.

## huggingface-cli login

In many cases, you must be logged in to a Hugging Face account to interact with the Hub (download private repos, upload files, create PRs, etc.). To do so, you need a [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) from your [Settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). The User Access Token is used to authenticate your identity to the Hub. Make sure to set a token with write access if you want to upload or modify content.

Once you have your token, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli login
```

This command will prompt you for a token. Copy-paste yours and press *Enter*. Then you'll be asked if the token should also be saved as a git credential. Press *Enter* again (default to yes) if you plan to use `git` locally. Finally, it will call the Hub to check that your token is valid and save it locally.

```
_|    _|  _|    _|    _|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|  _|      _|    _|_|_|      _|_|_|_|    _|_|      _|_|_|  _|_|_|_|

To login, `huggingface_hub` requires a token generated from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens .
Token:
Add token as git credential? (Y/n)
Token is valid (permission: write).
Your token has been saved in your configured git credential helpers (store).
Your token has been saved to /home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/token
Login successful
```

Alternatively, if you want to log-in without being prompted, you can pass the token directly from the command line. To be more secure, we recommend passing your token as an environment variable to avoid pasting it in your command history.

```bash
# Or using an environment variable
>>> huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN --add-to-git-credential
Token is valid (permission: write).
Your token has been saved in your configured git credential helpers (store).
Your token has been saved to /home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/token
Login successful
```

For more details about authentication, check out [this section](../quick-start#authentication).

## huggingface-cli whoami

If you want to know if you are logged in, you can use `huggingface-cli whoami`. This command doesn't have any options and simply prints your username and the organizations you are a part of on the Hub:

```bash
huggingface-cli whoami
Wauplin
orgs:  huggingface,eu-test,OAuthTesters,hf-accelerate,HFSmolCluster
```

If you are not logged in, an error message will be printed.

## huggingface-cli logout

This commands logs you out. In practice, it will delete the token saved on your machine.

This command will not log you out if you are logged in using the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable (see [reference](../package_reference/environment_variables#hftoken)). If that is the case, you must unset the environment variable in your machine configuration.

## huggingface-cli download


Use the `huggingface-cli download` command to download files from the Hub directly. Internally, it uses the same [`hf_hub_download`] and [`snapshot_download`] helpers described in the [Download](./download) guide and prints the returned path to the terminal. In the examples below, we will walk through the most common use cases. For a full list of available options, you can run:

```bash
huggingface-cli download --help
```

### Download a single file

To download a single file from a repo, simply provide the repo_id and filename as follow:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download gpt2 config.json
downloading https://huggingface.co/gpt2/resolve/main/config.json to /home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/tmpwrq8dm5o
(…)ingface.co/gpt2/resolve/main/config.json: 100%|██████████████████████████████████| 665/665 [00:00<00:00, 2.49MB/s]
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--gpt2/snapshots/11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10/config.json
```

The command will always print on the last line the path to the file on your local machine.

### Download an entire repository

In some cases, you just want to download all the files from a repository. This can be done by just specifying the repo id:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
Fetching 23 files:   0%|                                                | 0/23 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
...
...
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--HuggingFaceH4--zephyr-7b-beta/snapshots/3bac358730f8806e5c3dc7c7e19eb36e045bf720
```

### Download multiple files

You can also download a subset of the files from a repository with a single command. This can be done in two ways. If you already have a precise list of the files you want to download, you can simply provide them sequentially:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download gpt2 config.json model.safetensors
Fetching 2 files:   0%|                                                                        | 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
downloading https://huggingface.co/gpt2/resolve/11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10/model.safetensors to /home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/tmpdachpl3o
(…)8f278a7049802950aedb10/model.safetensors: 100%|██████████████████████████████| 8.09k/8.09k [00:00<00:00, 40.5MB/s]
Fetching 2 files: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:00<00:00,  3.76it/s]
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--gpt2/snapshots/11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10
```

The other approach is to provide patterns to filter which files you want to download using `--include` and `--exclude`. For example, if you want to download all safetensors files from [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0), except the files in FP16 precision:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 --include "*.safetensors" --exclude "*.fp16.*"*
Fetching 8 files:   0%|                                                                         | 0/8 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
...
...
Fetching 8 files: 100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 8/8 (...)
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--stabilityai--stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/snapshots/462165984030d82259a11f4367a4eed129e94a7b
```

### Download a dataset or a Space

The examples above show how to download from a model repository. To download a dataset or a Space, use the `--repo-type` option:

```bash
# https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k
>>> huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k --repo-type dataset

# https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat
>>> huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat --repo-type space

...
```

### Download a specific revision

The examples above show how to download from the latest commit on the main branch. To download from a specific revision (commit hash, branch name or tag), use the `--revision` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download bigcode/the-stack --repo-type dataset --revision v1.1
...
```

### Download to a local folder

The recommended (and default) way to download files from the Hub is to use the cache-system. However, in some cases you want to download files and move them to a specific folder. This is useful to get a workflow closer to what git commands offer. You can do that using the `--local-dir` option.

A `./huggingface/` folder is created at the root of your local directory containing metadata about the downloaded files. This prevents re-downloading files if they're already up-to-date. If the metadata has changed, then the new file version is downloaded. This makes the `local-dir` optimized for pulling only the latest changes.

<Tip>

For more details on how downloading to a local file works, check out the [download](./download.md#download-files-to-a-local-folder) guide.

</Tip>

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download adept/fuyu-8b model-00001-of-00002.safetensors --local-dir fuyu
...
fuyu/model-00001-of-00002.safetensors
```

### Specify cache directory

If not using `--local-dir`, all files will be downloaded by default to the cache directory defined by the `HF_HOME` [environment variable](../package_reference/environment_variables#hfhome). You can specify a custom cache using `--cache-dir`:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download adept/fuyu-8b --cache-dir ./path/to/cache
...
./path/to/cache/models--adept--fuyu-8b/snapshots/ddcacbcf5fdf9cc59ff01f6be6d6662624d9c745
```

### Specify a token

To access private or gated repositories, you must use a token. By default, the token saved locally (using `huggingface-cli login`) will be used. If you want to authenticate explicitly, use the `--token` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download gpt2 config.json --token=hf_****
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--gpt2/snapshots/11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10/config.json
```

### Quiet mode

By default, the `huggingface-cli download` command will be verbose. It will print details such as warning messages, information about the downloaded files, and progress bars. If you want to silence all of this, use the `--quiet` option. Only the last line (i.e. the path to the downloaded files) is printed. This can prove useful if you want to pass the output to another command in a script.

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli download gpt2 --quiet
/home/wauplin/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--gpt2/snapshots/11c5a3d5811f50298f278a704980280950aedb10
```

### Download timeout

On machines with slow connections, you might encounter timeout issues like this one:
```bash
`requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: (ReadTimeoutError("HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cdn-lfs-us-1.huggingface.co', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=10)"), '(Request ID: a33d910c-84c6-4514-8362-c705e2039d38)')`
```

To mitigate this issue, you can set the `HF_HUB_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` environment variable to a higher value (default is 10):
```bash
export HF_HUB_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=30
```

For more details, check out the [environment variables reference](../package_reference/environment_variables#hfhubdownloadtimeout).And rerun your download command.

## huggingface-cli upload

Use the `huggingface-cli upload` command to upload files to the Hub directly. Internally, it uses the same [`upload_file`] and [`upload_folder`] helpers described in the [Upload](./upload) guide. In the examples below, we will walk through the most common use cases. For a full list of available options, you can run:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload --help
```

### Upload an entire folder

The default usage for this command is:

```bash
# Usage:  huggingface-cli upload [repo_id] [local_path] [path_in_repo]
```

To upload the current directory at the root of the repo, use:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload my-cool-model . .
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main/
```

<Tip>

If the repo doesn't exist yet, it will be created automatically.

</Tip>

You can also upload a specific folder:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload my-cool-model ./models .
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main/
```

Finally, you can upload a folder to a specific destination on the repo:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload my-cool-model ./path/to/curated/data /data/train
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main/data/train
```

### Upload a single file

You can also upload a single file by setting `local_path` to point to a file on your machine. If that's the case, `path_in_repo` is optional and will default to the name of your local file:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-model ./models/model.safetensors
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/blob/main/model.safetensors
```

If you want to upload a single file to a specific directory, set `path_in_repo` accordingly:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-model ./models/model.safetensors /vae/model.safetensors
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/blob/main/vae/model.safetensors
```

### Upload multiple files

To upload multiple files from a folder at once without uploading the entire folder, use the `--include` and `--exclude` patterns. It can also be combined with the `--delete` option to delete files on the repo while uploading new ones. In the example below, we sync the local Space by deleting remote files and uploading all files except the ones in `/logs`:

```bash
# Sync local Space with Hub (upload new files except from logs/, delete removed files)
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/space-example --repo-type=space --exclude="/logs/*" --delete="*" --commit-message="Sync local Space with Hub"
...
```

### Upload to a dataset or Space

To upload to a dataset or a Space, use the `--repo-type` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-dataset ./data /train --repo-type=dataset
...
```

### Upload to an organization

To upload content to a repo owned by an organization instead of a personal repo, you must explicitly specify it in the `repo_id`:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload MyCoolOrganization/my-cool-model . .
https://huggingface.co/MyCoolOrganization/my-cool-model/tree/main/
```

### Upload to a specific revision

By default, files are uploaded to the `main` branch. If you want to upload files to another branch or reference, use the `--revision` option:

```bash
# Upload files to a PR
>>> huggingface-cli upload bigcode/the-stack . . --repo-type dataset --revision refs/pr/104
...
```

**Note:** if `revision` does not exist and `--create-pr` is not set, a branch will be created automatically from the `main` branch.

### Upload and create a PR

If you don't have the permission to push to a repo, you must open a PR and let the authors know about the changes you want to make. This can be done by setting the `--create-pr` option:

```bash
# Create a PR and upload the files to it
>>> huggingface-cli upload bigcode/the-stack . . --repo-type dataset --revision refs/pr/104
https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack/blob/refs%2Fpr%2F104/
```

### Upload at regular intervals

In some cases, you might want to push regular updates to a repo. For example, this is useful if you're training a model and you want to upload the logs folder every 10 minutes. You can do this using the `--every` option:

```bash
# Upload new logs every 10 minutes
huggingface-cli upload training-model logs/ --every=10
```

### Specify a commit message

Use the `--commit-message` and `--commit-description` to set a custom message and description for your commit instead of the default one

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-model ./models . --commit-message="Epoch 34/50" --commit-description="Val accuracy: 68%. Check tensorboard for more details."
...
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main
```

### Specify a token

To upload files, you must use a token. By default, the token saved locally (using `huggingface-cli login`) will be used. If you want to authenticate explicitly, use the `--token` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-model ./models . --token=hf_****
...
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main
```

### Quiet mode

By default, the `huggingface-cli upload` command will be verbose. It will print details such as warning messages, information about the uploaded files, and progress bars. If you want to silence all of this, use the `--quiet` option. Only the last line (i.e. the URL to the uploaded files) is printed. This can prove useful if you want to pass the output to another command in a script.

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/my-cool-model ./models . --quiet
https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-model/tree/main
```

## huggingface-cli repo-files

If you want to delete files from a Hugging Face repository, use the `huggingface-cli repo-files` command. 

### Delete files

The `huggingface-cli repo-files <repo_id> delete` sub-command allows you to delete files from a repository. Here are some usage examples.

Delete a folder :
```bash
>>> huggingface-cli repo-files Wauplin/my-cool-model delete folder/  
Files correctly deleted from repo. Commit: https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-mo...
```

Delete multiple files: 
```bash
>>> huggingface-cli repo-files Wauplin/my-cool-model delete file.txt folder/pytorch_model.bin
Files correctly deleted from repo. Commit: https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-mo...
```

Use Unix-style wildcards to delete sets of files: 
```bash
>>> huggingface-cli repo-files Wauplin/my-cool-model delete *.txt folder/*.bin 
Files correctly deleted from repo. Commit: https://huggingface.co/Wauplin/my-cool-mo...
```

### Specify a token

To delete files from a repo you must be authenticated and authorized. By default, the token saved locally (using `huggingface-cli login`) will be used. If you want to authenticate explicitly, use the `--token` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli repo-files --token=hf_**** Wauplin/my-cool-model delete file.txt 
```

## huggingface-cli scan-cache

Scanning your cache directory is useful if you want to know which repos you have downloaded and how much space it takes on your disk. You can do that by running `huggingface-cli scan-cache`:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli scan-cache
REPO ID                     REPO TYPE SIZE ON DISK NB FILES LAST_ACCESSED LAST_MODIFIED REFS                LOCAL PATH

```

For more details about how to scan your cache directory, please refer to the [Manage your cache](./manage-cache#scan-cache-from-the-terminal) guide.

## huggingface-cli delete-cache

`huggingface-cli delete-cache` is a tool that helps you delete parts of your cache that you don't use anymore. This is useful for saving and freeing disk space. To learn more about using this command, please refer to the [Manage your cache](./manage-cache#clean-cache-from-the-terminal) guide.

## huggingface-cli tag

The `huggingface-cli tag` command allows you to tag, untag, and list tags for repositories.

### Tag a model

To tag a repo, you need to provide the `repo_id` and the `tag` name:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli tag Wauplin/my-cool-model v1.0
You are about to create tag v1.0 on model Wauplin/my-cool-model
Tag v1.0 created on Wauplin/my-cool-model
```

### Tag a model at a specific revision

If you want to tag a specific revision, you can use the `--revision` option. By default, the tag will be created on the `main` branch:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli tag Wauplin/my-cool-model v1.0 --revision refs/pr/104
You are about to create tag v1.0 on model Wauplin/my-cool-model
Tag v1.0 created on Wauplin/my-cool-model
```

### Tag a dataset or a Space

If you want to tag a dataset or Space, you must specify the `--repo-type` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli tag bigcode/the-stack v1.0 --repo-type dataset
You are about to create tag v1.0 on dataset bigcode/the-stack
Tag v1.0 created on bigcode/the-stack
```

### List tags

To list all tags for a repository, use the `-l` or `--list` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli tag Wauplin/gradio-space-ci -l --repo-type space
Tags for space Wauplin/gradio-space-ci:
0.2.2
0.2.1

### Delete a tag

To delete a tag, use the `-d` or `--delete` option:

```bash
>>> huggingface-cli tag -d Wauplin/my-cool-model v1.0
You are about to delete tag v1.0 on model Wauplin/my-cool-model
Proceed? [Y/n] y
Tag v1.0 deleted on Wauplin/my-cool-model
```

You can also pass `-y` to skip the confirmation step.
