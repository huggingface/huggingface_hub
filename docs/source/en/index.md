# 🤗 Hub client library

The `huggingface_hub` library allows you to interact with the [Hugging Face
Hub](https://hf.co), a machine learning platform for creators and collaborators.
Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the hundreds of
machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models
and datasets with the community. The `huggingface_hub` library provides a simple way to
do all these things with Python.

Read the [quick start guide](quick-start) to get up and running with the
`huggingface_hub` library. You will learn how to download files from the Hub, create a
repository, and upload files to the Hub. Keep reading to learn more about how to manage
your repositories on the 🤗 Hub, how to interact in discussions or even how to run inference.
