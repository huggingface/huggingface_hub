# Strict Dataclasses

The `huggingface_hub` package provides a utility to create **strict dataclasses**. These are enhanced versions of Python's standard `dataclass` with additional validation features. Strict dataclasses ensure that fields are validated both during initialization and assignment, making them ideal for scenarios where data integrity is critical.

## Overview

Strict dataclasses are created using the `@strict` decorator. They extend the functionality of regular dataclasses by:

- Validating field types based on type hints
- Supporting custom validators for additional checks
- Optionally allowing arbitrary keyword arguments in the constructor
- Validating fields both at initialization and during assignment

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures fields always contain valid data
- **Ease of Use**: Integrates seamlessly with Python's `dataclass` module
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom validators for complex validation logic
- **Lightweight**: Requires no additional dependencies such as Pydantic, attrs, or similar libraries

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict, as_validated_field

# Custom validator to ensure a value is positive
@as_validated_field
def positive_int(value: int):
    if not value > 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Value must be positive, got {value}")

@strict
@dataclass
class Config:
    model_type: str
    hidden_size: int = positive_int(default=16)
    vocab_size: int = 32  # Default value

    # Methods named `validate_xxx` are treated as class-wise validators
    def validate_big_enough_vocab(self):
        if self.vocab_size < self.hidden_size:
            raise ValueError(f"vocab_size ({self.vocab_size}) must be greater than hidden_size ({self.hidden_size})")
```

Fields are validated during initialization:

```python
config = Config(model_type="bert", hidden_size=24)   # Valid
config = Config(model_type="bert", hidden_size=-1)   # Raises StrictDataclassFieldValidationError
```

Consistency between fields is also validated during initialization (class-wise validation):

```python
# `vocab_size` too small compared to `hidden_size`
config = Config(model_type="bert", hidden_size=32, vocab_size=16)   # Raises StrictDataclassClassValidationError
```

Fields are also validated during assignment:

```python
config.hidden_size = 512  # Valid
config.hidden_size = -1   # Raises StrictDataclassFieldValidationError
```

To re-run class-wide validation after assignment, you must call `.validate` explicitly:

```python
config.validate()  # Runs all class validators
```

### Custom Validators

You can attach multiple custom validators to fields using [`validated_field`]. A validator is a callable that takes a single argument and raises an exception if the value is invalid.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict, validated_field

def multiple_of_64(value: int):
    if value % 64 != 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Value must be a multiple of 64, got {value}")

@strict
@dataclass
class Config:
    hidden_size: int = validated_field(validator=[positive_int, multiple_of_64])
```

In this example, both validators are applied to the `hidden_size` field.

### Additional Keyword Arguments

By default, strict dataclasses only accept fields defined in the class. You can allow additional keyword arguments by setting `accept_kwargs=True` in the `@strict` decorator.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict

@strict(accept_kwargs=True)
@dataclass
class ConfigWithKwargs:
    model_type: str
    vocab_size: int = 16

config = ConfigWithKwargs(model_type="bert", vocab_size=30000, extra_field="extra_value")
print(config)  # ConfigWithKwargs(model_type='bert', vocab_size=30000, *extra_field='extra_value')
```

Additional keyword arguments appear in the string representation of the dataclass but are prefixed with `*` to highlight that they are not validated.

### Integration with Type Hints

Strict dataclasses respect type hints and validate them automatically. For example:

```python
from typing import List
from dataclasses import dataclass
from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict

@strict
@dataclass
class Config:
    layers: List[int]

config = Config(layers=[64, 128])  # Valid
config = Config(layers="not_a_list")  # Raises StrictDataclassFieldValidationError
```

Supported types include:
- Any
- Union
- Optional
- Literal
- List
- Dict
- Tuple
- Set

And any combination of these types. If your need more complex type validation, you can do it through a custom validator.

### Class validators

Methods named `validate_xxx` are treated as class validators. These methods must only take `self` as an argument. Class validators are run once during initialization, right after `__post_init__`. You can define as many of them as neededâ€”they'll be executed sequentially in the order they appear.

Note that class validators are not automatically re-run when a field is updated after initialization. To manually re-validate the object, you need to call `obj.validate()`.

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from huggingface_hub.dataclasses import strict

@strict
@dataclass
class Config:
    foo: str
    foo_length: int
    upper_case: bool = False

    def validate_foo_length(self):
        if len(self.foo) != self.foo_length:
            raise ValueError(f"foo must be {self.foo_length} characters long, got {len(self.foo)}")

    def validate_foo_casing(self):
        if self.upper_case and self.foo.upper() != self.foo:
            raise ValueError(f"foo must be uppercase, got {self.foo}")

config = Config(foo="bar", foo_length=3) # ok

config.upper_case = True
config.validate() # Raises StrictDataclassClassValidationError

Config(foo="abcd", foo_length=3) # Raises StrictDataclassFieldValidationError
Config(foo="Bar", foo_length=3, upper_case=True) # Raises StrictDataclassFieldValidationError
```

<Tip warning={true}>

Method `.validate()` is a reserved name on strict dataclasses.
To prevent unexpected behaviors, a [`StrictDataclassDefinitionError`] error will be raised if your class already defines one.

## Why Not Use `pydantic`? (or `attrs`? or `marshmallow_dataclass`?)

- See discussion in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/36329 regarding adding Pydantic as a dependency. It would be a heavy addition and require careful logic to support both v1 and v2.
- We don't need most of Pydantic's features, especially those related to automatic casting, jsonschema, serialization, aliases, etc.
- We don't need the ability to instantiate a class from a dictionary.
- We don't want to mutate data. In `@strict`, "validation" means "checking if a value is valid." In Pydantic, "validation" means "casting a value, possibly mutating it, and then checking if it's valid."
- We don't need blazing-fast validation. `@strict` isn't designed for heavy loads where performance is critical. Common use cases involve validating a model configuration (performed once and negligible compared to running a model). This allows us to keep the code minimal.
