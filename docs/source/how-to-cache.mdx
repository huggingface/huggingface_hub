# Manage `huggingface_hub` cache-system

## Understand caching

Huggingface Hub cache-system is designed to be the central cache shared across libraries 
that depend on the Hub. It has been updated in v0.8.0 to prevent re-downloading same files
between revisions.

The caching system is designed as follows:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ <MODELS>
├─ <DATASETS>
├─ <SPACES>
```

The `<CACHE_DIR>` is usually your user's home directory. However, it is customizable with the
`cache_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying the `HF_HOME` environment variable.

Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the namespace
(organization, username) if it exists, alongside the repository name:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small
├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp
├─ models--bert-base-cased
├─ datasets--glue
├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles
├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini
```

It is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the hub. Caching ensures that
a file isn't downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn't updated; but if it was updated,
and you're asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping
the previous file intact in case you need it again).

In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ datasets--glue
│  ├─ refs
│  ├─ blobs
│  ├─ snapshots
...
```

Each folder is designed to contain the following:

### Refs

The `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,
if we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`
folder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head.

If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`.

If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then
re-downloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`.

### Blobs

The `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash.

### Snapshots

The `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:
one per known revision!

In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from
the `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`
and `bbbbbb`.

In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,
if we had downloaded the `README.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:

```
<CACHE_DIR>/<REPO_NAME>/snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md
```

That `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file.

By creating the skeleton this way we open the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in
revision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be re-downloaded.

### In practice

In practice, your cache should look like the following tree:

```
    [  96]  .
    └── [ 160]  models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small
        ├── [ 160]  blobs

```

## Scan your cache

At the moment, cached files are never deleted from your local directory: when you download
a new revision of a branch, previous files would be kept in case you need them again.

### From the terminal

In you need to clean you local cache to save space, you can use the `scan-cache` command
from `huggingface-cli`. This command scans the cache and prints a report including details
like repo id, repo type, disk usage, refs and full local path. The output is in tabular
format so that it can be used with tools such as `grep` to filter the entries.

The snippet below shows a scan report in a folder in which 4 models and 2 datasets are
cached.

```

To get a more detailed report, use the `--verbose` option. For each repo, you get a
list of all revisions that have been downloaded. As explained above, the files that don't
change between 2 revisions are shared thanks to the symlinks. This means that the size of
the repo on disk is expected to be less than the sum of the size of each of its revisions.
For example, here `bert-base-cased` has 2 revisions of 1.4G and 1.5G but the total disk
usage is only 1.9G.

### From Python

For more advanced usage, a python utility is provided to scan your cache. You can use it
to get a detailed report in a structured format.
