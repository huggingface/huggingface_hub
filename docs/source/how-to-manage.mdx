# How to create and manage a repository

A repository is a space for you to store your model or dataset files. This guide will show you how to:

* Create and delete a repository.
* Adjust repository visibility.
* Use the [`Repository`] class for common Git operations like clone, branch, push, etc.

## Create a repository

Create an empty repository with [`create_repo`] and give it a name with the `repo_id` parameter. The `repo_id` is your namespace followed by the repository name: `{username_or_org}/{repo_name}`.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import create_repo
>>> create_repo("lysandre/test-model")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model'
```

By default, [`create_repo`] creates a model repository. But you can use the `repo_type` parameter to specify another repository type. For example, if you want to create a dataset repository:

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import create_repo
>>> create_repo("lysandre/test-dataset", repo_type="dataset")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-dataset'
```

When creating a repository, you also have the option to set your repository visibility with the `private` parameter. For example, if you want to create a private repository:

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import create_repo
>>> create_repo("lysandre/test-private", private=True)
```

If you want to change the repository visibility at a later time, you can use the [`update_repo_visibility`] function. 

## Delete a repository

Delete a repository with [`delete_repo`]. Make sure you are certain you want to delete a repository because this is an irreversible process!

Specify the `repo_id` of the repository you want to delete:

```py
>>> delete_repo(repo_id=name)
```

If you aren't sure what the `repo_id` is or you want to quickly retrieve it, you can also use the [`get_full_repo_name`] function:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import get_full_repo_name, delete_repo
>>> name = get_full_repo_name(repo_name)
>>> delete_repo(repo_id=name)
```

You can also specify the repository type to delete by adding the `repo_type` parameter:

```python
>>> delete_repo(repo_id=REPO_NAME, repo_type="dataset")
```

## Change repository visibility

A repository can be public or private. A private repository is only visible to you or members of the organization in which the repository is located. Change a repository to private as shown in the following:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import update_repo_visibility
>>> update_repo_visibility(name=REPO_NAME, private=True)
```

## The Repository class 

The [`Repository`] class allows you to interact with files and repositories on the Hub with functions similar to `git` commands. [`Repository`] is a wrapper over Git and Git-LFS methods, so make sure you have Git-LFS installed (see [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions) and set up before you begin. With [`Repository`], you can use the Git commands you already know and love.

### Use a local repository

Instantiate a [`Repository`] object with a path to a local repository:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import Repository
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="<path>/<to>/<folder>")
```

### Clone

The `clone_from` parameter clones a repository from a Hugging Face repository ID to a local directory specified by the `local_dir` argument:

```python
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="w2v2", clone_from="facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60")
```

`clone_from` can also clone a repository from a specified directory using a URL (if you are working offline, this parameter should be `None`):

```python
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="huggingface-hub", clone_from="https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60")
```

You can combine the `clone_from` parameter with [`create_repo`] to create and clone a repository:

```python
>>> repo_url = create_repo(repo_id="repo_name")
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="repo_local_path", clone_from=repo_url)
```

You can also attribute a Git username and email to a cloned repository by specifying the `git_user` and `git_email` parameters. When users commit to that repository, Git will be aware of the commit author.

```python
>>> repo = Repository(
...   "my-dataset", 
...   clone_from="<user>/<dataset_id>", 
...   use_auth_token=True, 
...   repo_type="dataset",
...   git_user="MyName",
...   git_email="me@cool.mail"
... )
```

### Branch

Branches are important for collaboration and experimentation without impacting your current files and code. Switch between branches with [`git_checkout`]. For example, if you want to switch from `branch1` to `branch2`:

```python
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="huggingface-hub", clone_from="<user>/<dataset_id>", revision='branch1')
>>> repo.git_checkout("branch2")
```

### Pull

Pull allows you to update a current local branch with changes from a remote repository:

```python
>>> repo.git_pull()
```

Set `rebase=True` if you want your local commits to occur after your branch is updated with the new commits from the remote:

```python
>>> repo.git_pull(rebase=True)
```

### Add

Stage a file to add to your repository with [`git_add]:

```py
>>> repo.git_add("path/to/file")
```

To automatically track large files (>10MB), set `auto_lfs_track=True`:

```py
>>> repo.git_add("path/to/file", auto_lfs_track=True)
```

### Commit

After staging a file to add, commit the staged changes with [`git_commit`]. You can also add a commit message to describe the changes:

```py
>>> repo.git_commit(commit_message="add my first model config file :)")
```

### Push

Finally, push your file to your repository with [`git_push`]:

```py
>>> repo.git_push()
```

Since this workflow is so common, there is a `commit` context manager to pull, add, commit and push files all in one step (see this [guide](how-to-upstream#commit-context-manager) for more details).
